def trilaterate(sensor_positions, distances):
    """
    Perform trilateration to estimate the location of a target based on sensor
    positions and measured distances.

    Args:
        sensor_positions (list of tuples): List of tuples containing (x, y) coordinates
                                           of sensor positions.
        distances (list of floats): List of distances from the target to each sensor.

    Returns:
        tuple: Estimated (x, y) coordinates of the target.
